              A: Yes, it is vegan! The warning about the potential presence of
              egg or milk is likely due to the facility not being entirely free
              from allergens. If your pal has allergy restrictions, consider
              this before sharing it with them.

              never arrives within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 3 months),
              please contact us at support@veganpackpal.com, and we'll assist
              you in resolving the situation.

            <Typography>
              A: It's essential to maintain a trusted and responsible swapping
              community. You can take steps to ensure the safety and quality of
              items by thoroughly communicating it through your profile, setting
              preferences and any dietary restrictions, and setting clear
              expectations for the swap on the About Me section. Additionally,
              consider using tracking services for packages and following our
              guidelines for safe swapping practices.

              fair and respectful in your swaps. We trust our community to share
              their culture and snack experiences, so it's your opportunity to

            <Typography>
              A: No, they are not considered vegan. While gummies may not
              contain eggs or dairy, many of them contain gelatin, which is
              derived from animal sources such as pig bones or fish bones.
              Gelatin is not considered vegan or vegetarian because it is a
              product of animal origin. To be truly vegan-friendly, gummies
              should be made without the use of gelatin and with alternative
              ingredients that align with vegan principles. üå±üö´üêñüêü
